# Iris Decision Tree Classifier

This project applies a Decision Tree Classifier to the well-known Iris flower dataset, demonstrating how machine learning can be used for multi-class classification tasks. The notebook walks through the complete process—from data exploration and visualization to model training, evaluation, and prediction. By leveraging libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Seaborn, this project serves as a practical and beginner-friendly example of applying supervised learning to real-world data.


## 📊 Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers with four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Each sample belongs to one of three species:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolour
- Iris Virginica
